**Structra** is an open-source tool licensed under the MIT License, designed to automate the creation of project structures from simple text-based tree representations. It is perfect for developers who frequently need to create empty directory structures and files for new projects or prototypes. Structra provides an easy, automated solution for this task by transforming tree-structured text files into actual file and folder hierarchies.

It works seamlessly with tools like **Skryper**, which generates project structure trees, and **Structra** turns these trees into empty project templates.

## Key Features

- **Automated Structure Generation**: Create entire directory and file structures with just one click, based on tree-structured text files.
- **File and Folder Creation**: Automatically create empty files and folders following the exact hierarchy outlined in the structure files.
- **Drag-and-Drop Support**: Drag and drop one or multiple tree-structure text files onto Structra, and it will generate the corresponding directory structure instantly.
- **Consistency and Reproducibility**: Ensure your project structures are consistently and accurately recreated every time.

## Example Project Structure

Here’s what a typical project generated by Structra might look like:

```
structra/
├── .gitignore
├── .git/
├── src/
│   ├── structra/
│   │   ├── __pycache__/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── logger_config.py
│   │   ├── main.py
│   │   └── structure_processor.py
├── tests/
│   ├── __pycache__/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── test_structra.py
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
```

This structure can be automatically generated from a simple text-based tree file using Structra.

## Installation

1. **Download Structra**: Visit the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jonaszeihe/structra/releases) page to download the latest version of Structra.

2. **Setup**:
   - Extract the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice.
   - Ensure Python 3.x is installed. If not, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To use Structra, simply run the `structra.exe` or the Python script in the directory where your tree structure file is located.

1. **Running Structra**:

   - Navigate to the directory containing `structra.exe` or the Python script.
   - Drag and drop a text file with the tree structure onto the executable, or run it via the command line:
     ```bash
     ./structra.exe /path/to/structure.txt
     ```
   - Structra will create the folders and files described in the tree file.

2. **Enabling Logging**:
   - If you need detailed logs for debugging, you can run Structra with logging enabled:
     ```bash
     ./structra.exe /path/to/structure.txt --logging
     ```
   - This will generate a log file alongside the created structure.

### Running from the Command Line

- Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where `structra.exe` is located:
  ```cmd
  cd C:\path\to\structra
  ```
  Run Structra:
  ```cmd
  structra.exe /path/to/structure.txt          # For normal execution
  structra.exe /path/to/structure.txt --logging # With logging enabled
  ```

## Development

If you’re interested in contributing to Structra or modifying it for your own needs, follow these steps to set up a development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jonaszeihe/structra.git
   cd structra
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Development Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Structra in Development Mode**:

   ```bash
   python src/main.py /path/to/structure.txt
   ```

5. **Build the Executable**:
   To build a standalone executable using PyInstaller:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --name structra --onefile --specpath src --noconfirm src/main.py
   ```
   The executable will be in the `dist/` folder.

## Integration with Skryper

Structra integrates seamlessly with [Skryper](https://github.com/jonaszeihe/skryper), a tool that generates tree structures from existing file systems. Use Skryper to create a project structure tree, and then feed that tree file into Structra to generate the corresponding empty directory structure on your system.

## AI-Aided Development

Structra was developed with AI-aided best practices, ensuring a clean and efficient codebase. It simplifies the creation of folder and file structures and maintains a high standard of organization and reproducibility.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any bugs or issues while using Structra, please report them by [creating an issue](https://github.com/jonaszeihe/structra/issues) on GitHub. Structra’s logging feature can provide valuable information when troubleshooting.
